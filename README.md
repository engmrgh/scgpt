# SC-GPT

This repository is the *unofficial* implementation of SC-GPT with the full paper title:

Few-shot Natural Language Generation for Task-Oriented Dialog Baolin Peng, Chenguang Zhu, Chunyuan Li, Xiujun Li, Jinchao Li, Michael Zeng and Jianfeng Gao

ArXiv paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12328

From the SC-GPT's original github:

> This repository is based on hugginface transformer package and OpenAI GPT-2, containing model training code and pretrained medium model checkpoint. 
> Some evaluation scripts are adapted from RNNLG.
> The results indicate that with minimal training examples, SC-GPT is able to generate natural language response given dialog acts naturally and adequately. It can be used to train an NLG model in new domains with very limited examples.
